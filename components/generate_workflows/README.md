# Component Name: Error

## Description

The Error component is a building block in a Yeager Workflow designed to raise exceptions and explicit error messages within the workflow. It allows for more controlled error handling and provides clear feedback to the user about the encountered issue.

## Input and Output Models

**Input Model:** A dictionary containing a key "message" where its value is a string describing a specific error details and optionally includes the key "code" with an integer error code.

**Output Model:** The Error component does not return any output data, as it explicitly raises an exception.

### Validation and Serialization

The Error component validates the input data by checking if the "message" key is present in the provided dictionary and that its associated value is of string type. The optional "code" is validated when provided in the input data; it should be an integer.

## Parameters

* **component_config: dict (required)**
  * Configuration dictionary with a key "message" and optionally "code".

## Transform Function

The transform() method of the Error component performs the following steps:

1. Validate the input data by ensuring the "message" key is present and that its value is of string type.
2. If the "code" key exists in the input data, validate that its value is an integer.
3. Raise a custom error with the defined message and error code.

## External Dependencies

The Error component does not have any external dependencies, as its functionality is built using Python's standard library.

## API Calls

The Error component does not make any external API calls.

## Error Handling

The Error component handles errors by raising a custom exception defined by the input data. Any specific exceptions and error messages will come from the provided "message" and "code" in the input data.

## Examples
