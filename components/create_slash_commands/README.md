# Component Name: CreateSlashCommands

## Description

This Yeager component is responsible for creating command functions for a list of generated workflows. It generates source code using the powerful GPT-4 model by OpenAI for these command functions, based on a given master prompt and the workflow names.

## Input and Output Models

### Input Model: `CreateSlashCommandsInputDict`

The input model is a [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) data class consisting of:

- `master_prompt` (str): The master prompt for guiding the GPT-4 model.
- `list_generated_workflows` (List[str]): A list of generated workflow names that the command functions will be created for.

### Output Model: `CreateSlashCommandsOutputDict`

The output model is also a Pydantic data class consisting of:

- `source_code` (str): The generated source code for the command functions.

## Parameters

This component uses the following parameters:

- `master_prompt` (str): The master prompt for guiding the GPT-4 model, obtained from the component's configuration file.
- `openai_api_key` (Optional[str]): The OpenAI API key, which is retrieved from the environment.

## Transform Function

The `transform()` function implementation can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Set the OpenAI API key.
2. Initialize an empty list for storing the generated command functions.
3. For each workflow name in the input list,
    1. Make an API call to OpenAI's GPT-4 model with the master prompt and a user message to create a command function for the given workflow.
    2. Extract the generated command function from the API response.
    3. Add the generated command function to the list of command functions.
4. Return an instance of `CreateSlashCommandsOutputDict` with the concatenated command functions as source code.

## External Dependencies

This component makes use of the following external libraries:

- `openai`: For accessing the GPT-4 model and generating source code for command functions.
- `yaml`: For safely loading the component's configuration file.
- `os`: For retrieving the OpenAI API key from environment variables.
- `typing`: For type hinting.

## API Calls

The component makes the following API call to OpenAI's GPT-4 model:

- `openai.ChatCompletion.create()`: This call sends input messages to the GPT-4 model, including the master prompt and a user message specifying the workflow for which a command function should be created, and returns the generated command function as output.

## Error Handling

The component follows the error handling provided by the underlying API and external libraries. It does not implement any custom error handling.

## Examples

To use the `CreateSlashCommands` component in a Yeager Workflow:

1. Ensure that the OpenAI API key is set as an environment variable.
2. Define your component configuration file with the desired `master_prompt`.
3. Instantiate the component:
